Phase 1: The Foundation (Skeleton)
Goal: Get the class to compile, hold text, and manage its own memory safely.

Create the Base Class (StaticStringBase)

Add the protected members: a pointer to the buffer, a variable for capacity, and a variable for current length.

Write the constructor: It must take a pointer and a size, then initialize the length to 0 and place a null-terminator (\0) at index 0.

Task: Implement length(), capacity(), and c_str() (accessors).

Task: Implement operator[] so you can read specific characters (e.g., char c = str[0];).

Create the Template Class (FixedString<N>)

Inherit from StaticStringBase.

Define the actual char array storage[N+1] inside this class.

Task: Write the constructor that passes storage and N up to the Base Class.

Task: Write a Copy Constructor that accepts const StaticStringBase&. Crucial: This allows a FixedString<32> to be created from a FixedString<16>.

Implement Assignment

Task: In the Base Class, implement operator=(const char*) (standard C-string assignment).

Task: In the Base Class, implement operator=(const StaticStringBase&) (copying from another object).

Rule: Ensure you copy the data bytes, not the pointer!

Phase 2: Growth (Concatenation)
Goal: Make str += "abc" and str += 123 work.

Core Append Logic

Task: Write a protected helper function (e.g., append_impl).

Logic: Check if current_length + new_length fits in capacity. If yes, memcpy the data and update the length. If no, decide whether to truncate or do nothing. Always ensure the null-terminator is added at the end.

The "Concat" Functions

Task: Implement concat(char c).

Task: Implement concat(const char* str).

Task: Implement concat(int num).

Hint for numbers: Look up snprintf. It allows you to format a number directly into your buffer safely (e.g., snprintf(buffer + len, remaining_space, "%d", num)).

Operator Overloads

Task: Implement operator+= for char, const char*, and int. These should just be thin wrappers that call your concat functions.

Phase 3: Comparison & Search (The Logic)
Goal: Make if (str == "cmd") and parsing work.

Equality Checks

Task: Implement operator== to compare against another StaticStringBase.

Task: Implement operator== to compare against a const char*.

Hint: Use strcmp inside these functions.

Search Tools

Task: Implement indexOf(char c). Hint: Loop through the buffer or use strchr.

Task: Implement startsWith(const char* prefix). Hint: Use strncmp.

Phase 4: Utilities (Data Manipulation)
Goal: Add the tools needed to clean up data.

Trimming

Task: Implement trim().

Logic: Find the first non-space character and the last non-space character. Use memmove (not memcpy) to shift that block to the start of the buffer, then place a null-terminator after it.

Conversions

Task: Implement toInt(). Hint: Use atol or strtol on your buffer.

Modern C++ Support (Optional)

Task: Add a conversion operator to std::string_view. This lets your string work instantly with modern C++ libraries.

Phase 5: Verification
Goal: Prove it is safe.

The Overflow Test: Create a FixedString<5>. Try to append "Hello World". Ensure the string contains "Hello" (or "Hell") and does not crash or corrupt memory.

The Mix-and-Match Test: Assign a small string to a big string, and a big string to a small string. Ensure the data copies correctly and respects the limits of the destination.
